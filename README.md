# roofing-estimation-tool
A roofing estimation tool that helps automate and streamline some of the cost calculations for roof installations.

# Project Summary
This project is a prototype of a roofing estimation tool I developed for my graduation project in collaboration with TPC Roofing. It was created to streamline and automate their existing manual, Excel-based estimation workflow, improving accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.

# Problem Addressed
Estimators at TPC Roofing faced challenges such as:
- Manual data entry errors
- Slow supplier price updates
- Inefficient proposal generation
These issues limited productivity and consistency across estimation tasks.

# Solution Developed
The solution involved:
- Backend automation for production quantity and material cost calculations
- A centralized SQLite database to manage pricing and production data
- A user input interface with validation to minimise errors

# Technologies Used
- Python (core backend calculations and terminal interface)
- SQL (data management)
- Excel (initial calculations and integration plans)
- UI/UX wireframing tools for interface design
- Eel (Python library for frontend and backend communication and desktop GUI integration)

# Requirements
eel==0.18.2
